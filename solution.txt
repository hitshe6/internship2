With respect to this collection {_id, name, phone, address, age, sex}

We can search the element using find() with respect to _id
We can also sort with respect to name and _id so that the find() can get element easily

First we need to analyze the queries to avoid errors and delay in exwcution.

EXAMPLE : db.user.find().sort({name:1,_id:1});
